- 👋 Hi, I’m @NicholasB85
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, App development and Small business operations.
-   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Kotlin, Swift, PHP, Python. 
- 
-   I have been more focused on IT for past few years but completely out of the job market, just helping set up small networks, 
-   running wires and stuff like that. I now am looking to find passion in coding again.
-   The last company I worked for left me hating web development and I probably need to brush up on some skills because I was teaching students Full-Stack Development. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Ruby, React.js, Anngular, Vue, SQL, noSQL, MongoDB, Node, Pearl, C, C++, C#, some Python, plus a few other skills I learned over the last 23 years but most are outdated.  
-   
-   I may remember a lot of what I have learned over the years. Still, taking an extended time away from coding means for me to feel comfortable outside of the basics I am re-teaching myself many things. Luckily, I learn very quickly 
-   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Honestly, I am not currently looking to collaborate with anyone on the day I am writing this but if my business plans start to take off. I will need to step away from the coding again and focus on the manufaturing and sales of my project.
-   This is an old github account with very basic projects which I just plan on deleting and my email is private at the time I am writing this. If the         right project comes along or I see someone that needs help if I can help them I will. When a project comes up where I am looking for others to             collaborate with, then I will change this file to reflect that change. 
-   
- 📫 How to reach me ... Currently, I have no number or email public on this account which is why I am using it. I will update that if I grow to need           collaboration or to hire people.
